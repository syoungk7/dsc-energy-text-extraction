NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY & STRATEGIES OF SRI LANKA
MINISTRY OF POWER AND ENERGY
GOVERNMENT OF SRI LANKA
CHALLENGES faced by Sri Lanka’s Energy Sector are many. While ensuring a continuous supply of electricity and petroleumproducts, the growing economy has to manage a strategic balance between indigenous energy resources and imported fossilfuels. Electricity supply to household needs is yet to reach a quarter of Sri Lanka’s population. Commercial energy utilities arerequired to be further strengthened to improve their financial viability and service quality. The involvement of the country’spopulation in the investment, operation, regulation and delivery of energy services needs to be increased.

This document declares the National Energy Policy of Sri Lanka, and spells out the implementing strategies,specific targets and milestones through which the Government of Sri Lanka and its people would endeavour to develop andmanage the energy sector in the coming yeas in order to facilitate achieving its millennium development goals. Specific newinitiatives are included in this policy to expand the delivery of affordable energy services to a larger share of the population,to improve energy sector planning, management and regulation, and to revitalise biomass as a significant resource ofcommercial energy.
Institutional responsibilities to implement each policy element and associated strategies to reach the specifiedtargets are also stated in this document. Ministry of Power and Energy has discussed the draft document with a wide groupof stakeholders and made the necessary amendments before publishing it as the National Energy Policy and Strategies of SriLanka.
1.1
Energy Supply
1 INTRODUCTION
Energy supply in Sri Lanka is mainly based on three primary resources, namely, biomass, petroleum andhydroelectricity. In 2004, hydro-electricity production in the country accounted for 706.9 kTOE (thousand tonnes of oilequivalent) while the biomass-based energy supply was 4,494.4 kTOE. Approximately 4,304.2 kTOE was provided by importedcrude oil and finished petroleum products such as diesel and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Additionally, the non-conventionalresources (mainly wind) provided 3.5 kTOE of primary energy, giving an aggregate primary energy supply of approximately9,509.1 kTOE. The 2004 primary energy contributions to national energy supply were 47.3% from biomass, 45.3% from crudeoil and petroleum products and 7.4% from hydroelectricity. The use of non-conventional energy resources in Sri Lanka is ofa relatively smaller scale and therefore its contribution is presently of low significance in the macro energy picture.
1.2
Energy Demand Growth
With the increasing demand for energy to provide for the country’s economic and social development, total primaryenergy demand is expected to increase to about 15,000 kTOE by the year 2020 at an average annual growth rate of about 3%.Electricity and petroleum sub-sectors are likely to record higher annual growth rates of about 7-8%. Hydro electricityproduction and biomass-based energy supplies, which are the only large-scale indigenous primary energy resources availablein Sri Lanka, are expected to increase only marginally in the near future. This is mainly due to limitations in further hydropowerdevelopment owing to lower economic viability of exploiting the remaining large hydropower sites and limited use of biomasswith gradually increasing standard of living of the population. This means that the country’s incremental primary energyrequirements need to be supplied mainly by imported fossil fuels in the medium term. In the longer term, possible developmentof indigenous petroleum resources and accelerated development of non-conventional renewable energy are likely to make asignificant change in Sri Lanka’s mix of primary energy resources.
1.3
Energy Sector Governance
Electricity and petroleum are the two main commercial energy supply sub-sectors in Sri Lanka. Both these sub-
sectors, which are largely served by state-owned utilities, are presently undergoing process of reforms.
Biomass and wind are also emerging as significant forms of commercial energy.
The electricity supply industry is dominated by state sector institutions, namely the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB)and Lanka Electricity Company (Pvt.) Ltd. (LECO). CEB is expected to be unbundled vertically and horizontally to form onegeneration company, a single transmission and bulk-power trading company and several distribution companies. Aregulatory structure in the form of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) is already in place, for all physicalinfrastructure sectors, inclusive of the electricity and petroleum industries.
Although the PUCSL has been already set up under the provisions of the Public Utilities Commission ofSri Lanka Act No. 35 of 2002 to regulate the physical infrastructure sectors, it will be empowered to execute regulation onlywhen the individual industry legislations are enacted and made effective. At present, only the electricity industry, the waterservice industry and petroleum industry are listed in the PUCSL Act.

LPG industry is owned by the private sector except for the contribution of about 15% of to the total LPG supply bythe state-owned Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CEYPETCO), which is the only player at present in the petroleum refiningbusiness. CEYPETCO is already competing with Lanka Indian Oil Company (Lanka IOC) in petroleum distribution. A thirdplayer could also join petroleum distribution, but this has been temporarily suspended by the Government due to the lack ofanticipated benefits to the country and its consumers through the liberalization and part privatization of the downstreampetroleum sub-sector. PUCSL, which will be the future petroleum sub-sector regulator, will have the authority to decide on thefuture structure of the petroleum sub sector.
Biomass still remains a sub-sector not formally organised unlike the electricity and petroleum sub-sectors. With newdevelopments where contribution of biomass as a primary resource of energy for electricity generation could becomesubstantial, the biomass sub-sector would also become more organised.
The “National Energy Policy and Strategies of Sri Lanka” is elaborated in three sections in this policy document.
*
*
*
“Energy Policy Elements” consists of the fundamental principles that guide the development and future directionof Sri Lanka’s Energy Sector.
“Implementing Strategies” states the implementation framework to achieve each policy element.
“Specific Targets, Milestones and Institutional Responsibilities” state the national targets, and the planningand institutional responsibilities to implement the strategies.
This National Energy Policy and Strategies of Sri Lanka shall be reviewed and revised after a period of three years.
2.1
Providing Basic Energy Needs
2 ENERGY POLICY ELEMENTS
*
Energy requirements to fulfil the basic needs of the people  and to enhance their living standards andopportunities for gainful economic activity will be adequately and continually satisfied at the lowest possiblecost to the economy.
Creating the necessary framework to provide the basic energy needs of the population is recognised as aprimary social responsibility of the state. Further, the importance of maintaining the adequacy and the continuityof energy supplies at the lowest cost to the economy to satisfy the increasing energy requirement of thepopulation, arising from the country’s economic development, is also recognised by the state.
2.2
Ensuring Energy Secutiry
*
Energy resources used in the country will be diversified and the future energy mix will be rationalized.
The primary and secondary energy resources used in the country will be diversified to maximise the country’senergy security. To ensure the continuity of supply, the future energy mix will be rationalized, consideringimportant factors such as the economic cost, environmental impacts (including those on existing hydropowerproject catchment areas), reliability of supplies, convenience to consumers and strategic independence.
2.3
Promoting Energy Efficiency and Conservation
*
Energy supply systems will be efficiently managed and operated while also ensuring efficient utilisation andconservation of energy.
Efficient management and operation of the energy sector utilities are vital to ensure minimum cost of supply toconsumers. Efficient utilisation of energy by all concerned, from utilities (supply-side management) to finalconsumers (demand-side management) not only saves valuable resources of the country but also reduces theoverall cost of energy to the consumer. Meaningful conservation of energy will be pursued at all times.

PART I : SEC. (I) - GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 10.06.2008
Promoting Indigenous Resources
*
Indigenous energy resources will be developed to the optimum levels to minimise dependence on non-indigenousresources, subject to resolving economic, environmental and social constraints.
Minimum dependence on non-indigenous resources and optimum development of local energy resources willminimise the vulnerability of energy supplies to external factors such as the international socio-politicalenvironment. Further, it also eases pressure on the country’s balance of payments. The Energy Policy includesnecessary initiatives to vigorously implement the country’s oil and gas exploration programme.
2.5
Adopting an Appropriate Pricing Policy
* An appropriate pricing policy for the energy sector will be adopted considering important factors such as costreflectivity, need for targeted subsidies, and competitiveness of locally produced goods and services in theregional and world markets.
Non-cost reflective pricing and non-targeted subsidies both in the electricity and petroleum sub-sectors in theabsence of a property regulatory mechanism, seriously hamper the growth and financial viability of sub-sectorutilities. Further, they drain state financial resources away from social infrastructure such as healthcare andeducation, which deserve to demand significant levels of state funding. At the same time, it is important to makepricing decisions on energy products and services taking into account the impacts of such decisions on thecompetitiveness of local goods and services in the regional and global markets. It is also necessary that onlythe costs incurred prudently by the utilities are allowed in the cost-recovering process.
2.6
Enhancing Energy Sector Management Capacity
* All measures will be taken to continually enhance the local capacity to develop and manage the energy sectoreffectively, giving due emphasis to the technological developments and goods governance in the energysector.
The local capacity to develop and manage the energy sector has been built over the years. This capacityneeds to be constantly enhanced, taking into account the continuous technological developments in theenergy sector. The management capability of the energy sector professionals needs to be enhanced to meetchallenges in the emerging competitive environment in the sector and to ensure good governance.
2.7
Consumer Protection and Ensuring a Level Playing Field
* Necessary measures will be taken to safeguard interests of both present and future consumers while ensuring
a level playing field for all the stakeholders in the energy sector.
The state accepts that both present and further consumers and the main stakeholders do not presently enjoytheir rightful place in the electricity/petroleum sub-sectors. Also, the country has so far failed to prove toinvestors the stability of the energy sector and also exhibit a level playing field. Therefore, necessary steps willbe taken to protect the interests of the consumers, and to ensure fairness and predictability to all energy sectorinvestors.
2.8
Enhancing the Quality of Energy Services
*
the quality of energy services will be ensured through imposition of appropriate quality standards and regulatoryinterventions.
Poor quality of energy services affects the country’s economic growth and the general standard of living of thepublic. Corrective action will be taken to make improvements in this regard, focusing on the consumer interests.
2.9
Protection from Adverse Environmental Impacts of Energy Facilities
* Necessary steps will be taken to minimum adverse environmental and social impacts caused by electricity and
petroleum sub-sector development and operational activities.

PART I : SEC. (I) - GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 10.06.2008
Adverse impacts on society and the environment arising out of the electricity and petroleum sub-sectoractivities have not been receiving adequate attention. The state recognises that it is the prime duty of thestate to protect the public and employees in this respect.
All developments and operations of energy sector facilities shall follow the relevant environmental regulationsand standards of Sri Lanka.
3 IMPLEMENTING  STRATEGIES
The broad strategies to implement the energy sector policies are as follows :
3.1
Providing Basic Energy Needs
*
Priority will be given to improving access by rural areas to commercial energy forms such as electricity andpetroleum-based fuels.
* Current modalities of providing basic electricity requirements of the entire population either through grid-extension or off-grid systems will be expanded and a systematic action-plan will be implemented to meet thoserequirements.
* Dedicated energy plantations will be encouraged.
* A transparent mechanism will be established to provide subsidies to the deserving groups to ensure that suchgroups have access to their basic energy needs at affordable prices. This includes providing low coststandardised electricity connections to consumers on lifeline tariffs both in urban and rural areas. It alsoincludes improving the availability of petroleum-based fuels in rural areas at standard retail prices, whileproviding kerosene subsidies to deserving low-income groups in both urban and rural areas.
3.2
Ensuring Energy Security
*
*
Fuel diversity in electricity generation will be ensured through diversifying into generation technologies thatdo not use oil or fuels of which the price is indexed to oil prices.
Fuel diversification in the transport sector will be encouraged through rail and road transport systems based onoff-peak electricity supply, and the promotion of bio-fuels as a high priority research and development need.
* Regional cooperation will be promoted in different forms including viable cross-border energy transfer with
neighboring countries.
*
Expansion of the local crude oil refining capacity to optimally satisfy the country’s demand for petroleumproducts will be pursued.
* Maintenance of a strategic fuel reserve by every player in the retail business will be ensured.
* Development of bio-fuels for transport will be encouraged.
3.3
Promoting Energy Efficiency and Conservation
*
Supply side and end-use energy efficiency will be encouraged through financial and other incentives/disincentives in respect of energy end-use mandatory measures such as appliance energy labelling, buildingcodes and energy audits.

Private sector participation in providind expert services on energy efficiency will be promoted and facilitated.
Financial resources required to continuously improve efficiency in energy conversion, transmission andutilisation will be acquired from within and outside the energy sector by levying appropriate energy chargesand formulating long term funding programmes with financiers.
The Energy Conservation Fund(ECF) will be entrunsted to coordinate all the activities relating to energyconservation and management, and the Energy Conservation Fund Act will be amended to accommodate thesenew responsibilities.
The use of existing petroleum distribution infrastructure will be optimised.
Power generation and network losses will be brought down to lowest possible levels and capacity will beimproved through necessary generation, transmission and distribution investments and efficient managementof the supply systems.
Efforts will be made to encourage electrification of viable sectors of the railway network and inter-modal shift inpassenger and goods transport towards more energy efficient systems.
* A model shift towards larger-capacity vehicular transport modes, which are less energy intensive per passengerkilometre or freight-tonne kilometre, will be promoted. Railway transportation will receive priority over roadtransportation.
* Better coordination of road and rail transport will be promoted as a key implementation strategy of achieving
greater efficiency of the transport sector.
* A strategic plan for street lighting will be formulated for the country to ensure proper management of streetlighting which will enhance the safety of motorists and pedestrians and also contribute to energy conservationwith better aesthetic sense.
3.4
Promoting Indegenous Resources
*
The use of economically viable, environment friendly, non-conventional renewable energy resources will bepromoted by providing a level playing field for developers of non-conventional energy resources.
* Concessionary financing will be sought to implement the remaining medium scale hydroelectric projects whichare economically, environmentally and socially viable, but not viable under normal commercial terms. Pricing ofelectricity generated would, however, be on commercial terms.
* Necessary incentives will be provided and access to green funding including Clean Development Mechanism(CDM) will be facilitated to develop non-conventional renewable energy resources to ensure their contributionto the energy supply in special situations, even if their economic viablility is marginal.
* A facilitation agency dedicated to the systematic planning and promotion of non-conventional renewable
energy resources will be established.
* Oil and natural gas resources will be explored and commercially exploited; both public and private sector
investment will be promoted in this regard.
* Biomass-based energy projects will be developed in areas where land resources are available, enabling new
industrial activities in such areas, empahasising on creating rural income generation avenues.
* Research and development on adopting new technologies and practices, particularly in the use of non-
conventional renewable energy to suit local conditions will be promoted.
*
*
Focused attention will be drawn on development of bio-fuels as an alternative energy resources for the transportsector.
Initiatives of other sectors and institutions to convert biomass and other waste to energy will be encouragedand supported where appropriate.

4.3
Fuel Diversity and Security
*
*
The electricity sub-sector shall rapidly move from the present two-energy resource (hydropower and oil) statusto a multiple resource status.
The Government shall not initiate or entertain any proposal either by the electricity utilities or private developersto build power plants that wil use oil, oil-based products or fuels of which the price is indexed to the oil price,unless they are required to be included in the generation expansion plan due to technical limitations in otherplant types. This moratorium on oil-based power plants shall be factored into the Long Term GenerationExpansion Plan(LTGEP) and shall remain in force until 80% of Sri Lanka’s electrical energy supplied to thenational grid is from non-oil based fuels. The strategy of the Government shall be immediately diversify into athird fuel. To ensure maximum possible security against price and supply fluctuations, and to ensure thegrowing demand is reliably met, this third fuel shall be coal. The LTGEP studies confirm the viability of thisstrategy. Non-conventional Renewable Energy (NRE) shall be the fourth resource in this deversification andsecurity strategy. Following are the electricity generation targets envisaged with NRE and coal resources.

*
Every player in the petroleum sub-sector downstream retail business shall maintain a strategic fuel reserveequivalent to a minimumof 30 days’ consumption at any given time. Every effort will be made to replacepetroleum-based fuesl with indegenous biomass fueld in industrial thermal applications by encouraging suchfuel switching initiatives through appropriate incentive, including facilitation of access to green fundingsuch as CDM.
Institutional responsibility to implement this fuel diversity and security policy, and to achieve targets will lie with thePUCSL, electricity utilities and petroleum sub-sector downstream players. The Long-Term Generation Expansion Plan(LTGEP) shall reflect the above strategy and milestones. LTGEP shall be a 20-year plan, updated at least once in twoyears.
4.4
Non-conventional Renewable Energy(NRE) Based Electricity in the Grid
* NRE Resources include small-scale hydropower, biomass including dendro power, biogas and waste, solarpower and wind power. These are the  leading sustainable, non-conventional forms of renewable energypromoted in Sri Lanka for electricity generation into the grid. In addition, other NRE resources such as waveenergy and ocean thermal energy are also encouraged where appropriate.
* Commercial development of biomass will be encouraged and facilitated as a new rural industry, allowingrural poor to engage in fuelwool farming and participate in the mainstream economic activity by supplyingelectricity to urban load centres.
*
The Government will endeavour to reach a minimum level of 10% of electrical energy supplied to the grid tobe from NRE by a process of facilitation including access to green funding such as CDM. The target year toreach this level of NRE penetration is 2015.
* A review of technical limits and financial constraints of absorbing NRE will be carried out an will be followed bya technical and financial barrier removal exercise, with external support and expertise where necessary.
*
*
*
The NRE strategy shall not cause any additional burden on the end use customer tariffs. If justified, theGovernment may subsidize the energy utilities for this purpose.
The Government recognises that certain NRE technologies would require incentives to ensure their capacitybuild-up to contribute to the national NRE target. These incentives shall be provided on a competitive basis, inwhich the NRE developlers shall bid for a share of the NRE target subject to a price ceiling. NRE incentives shallbe technology-specific and based on actual energy supplied to the grid.
To make available the incentives for NRE technologies, the Government will create an ‘Energy Fund’ ,which willbe managed by the ECF. This fund will be strengthened through an energy cess, grants received from donorsand well wishers, as well as any funds received under CDM. This fund will be used to provide incentives for thepromotion of NRE technologies and strengthen the transmission network to absorb the NRE technologies intothe grid.
* NRE developments will not be charged any resource cost(royalty) for a period of 15 years from the commercialoperation date. Resource costs charges from selected NRE technologies after the 15th year of commercialoperation shall be used to finance incentives for further NRE development, through the Energy Fund.
Institutional responsibility to implement this NRE strategy and to achieve targets shall lie with the PUCSL and ECF.The ECF shall prepare a Long-term Non-conventional Renewable Energy Plan (LTNREP), which shall provide interimtargets for specific NRE technologies, upper thresholds of pricing, and resource costing. The LTNREP shall be a 20 yearplan, updated at least once in two years. Implementation of the LTNREP shall be promoted and facilitated by ECF.

4.5
Electricity Pricing
* Average electricity price to each category of consumers will be gradually made cost reflective. A conduciveenvironment will be created to fully utilise the Demand Side Management (DSM) opportunities arising fromthis change.
*
*
The lifeline tariff to domestic consumers will be limited to Samurdhi Beneficiaries and to a monthly householdconsumption of 30kWh. The related subsidy component estimated at 50% of the cost of supply will be fullyfinanced through Government grants.
Electricity generation prices at bulk purchase points will be as stated in the Power Purchase Agreements, andthe cost of transmission distribution and supply will be regulated ensuring fairness to both consumers andelectricity utilities. Consumers and all other stake holders will be given opportunities to present their views ata public hearing.
Institutional responsibility to implement the electricity pricing policy lies with the PUCSL, electricity utilities and theGeneral Treasury. Electricty distribution utilities shall prepare tariff proposals for the approval of PUCSL, which will seekconcurrence of the Treasury on Government subsidy.
4.6
Petroleum sub-sector Regulation and Product Pricing
Prices of petroleum-based fuels will be determined using an agreed price formula between the Government and thepetroleum sub-sector utilities regulated by the PUCSL. Price regulation will apply only to petroleum-based fuels marketed ina non-competitive environment. Petroleum product imports and their country-wide distribution will be carried out throughthe common user facilities, which will also be regulated by the PUCSL. No general subsidy will be provided to any of theproducts and the marketing companies will be allowed to decide on their retail consumer prices within the specified maximumretail consumer prices for the period. Targeted subsidies wille be made available to low income households(SamurdhiBeneficiaries) for kerosene usage. Subsidies provided for other petroleum-based fuels will be removed by 2007.
Institutional responsibility to implement this lies with PUCSL, petroleum sub-sector utilities and the Treasury. Petroleumdistributors shall prepare the product pricing proposals according to the agreed formula for the approval of the PUCSLwhich will seek concurrence of the Treasury on the Government subsidy.

Oil and Gas Exploration
Comprehensive seismic acquisition in the Gulf of Mannar Basin were carried out in mid 2005. Announcement of afirst licensing round will be made in 2006 to offer blocks for exploration. More detailed 2D seismic and 3D seismic investigationswill be carried out in the Cauvery basin and in the southern area in 2006/2007.
Institutional responsibility to implement all steps to ensure that exploration and exploitation of petroleum resources arecarried out with appropriate investor participation adopting internationally recognised practices and proven technology lieswith the Ministry of Petroleum and Petroleum Resources Development.

Bunkering
The Strategic geographical location of Sri Lanka places it in a very favourable situation to become a leader in thebunkering business in South Asia. Action has already been taken to liberalize this industry, but it has failed to attractinvestors owing to certain obstacles. Immediate action will be taken to remove all such obstacles and to provide a levelplaying field to ensure participation of all leading palyers in the world, to make this one of the leading industries in Sri Lanka.This process of liberalization will be completed by end 2007.
Institutional responsibility to implement this lies with the Ministry of Petroleum and Petroleum Resources
Development, Ministry of Finance and the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka.

Supply-side Energy Efficiency
*
*
*
Transmission and distribution energy losses(the sum of technical and commercial losses) in the electricitysub-sector will be gradually brought down to a maximum of 13.5% net generation by end 2009. Every effort willbe made to expedite the loss reduction programme and exceed these expectations.
Present system control procedures towards optimal operation of the intergrated hydro-thermal power systemwill be improved by end 2007 to ensure maximum energy output from the hydropower system.
Informed rehabilitation/new investment decisions will be made in the national interest, to improve electricityproduction and transmission efficiency, guided by information gathered from continuous measurement ofenergy entering and leaving specific power system components.
Institutional responsibility to implement  this strategy and to achieve targets lies with the electricity utilities and thePUCSL.
4.10
Demand -side Energy Efficiency
* All appliances which substantially contribute towards electricity demand will be identified and labelled basedon their energy efficiency by end 2010, allowing consumers to make informed purchase decisions, Labelling willbe also used to lay more emphasis on appliance life cycle cost rather than the cost of acquisition, and therebyguiding fiscal policy especially in deciding import duty on appliances.
* Continuous refinement of the labelling programme will be used to introduce efficient technologies and togradually phase out the import and manufacture of inefficient appliances. The appliance labelling programmewill be made mandatory to identified appliances by mid 2007.
* Delivery of energy efficiency services will be accelerated by further developing the capacity of private andpublic sector energy service providers. New entrants to provide energy efficiency services will be encouragedand supported by interventions such as provision of expensive instruments on loan basis and analyticalinformation relevant to local circumstances.
* Benchmarks on energy intensity of specific industries will be established by end 2007. Specific benchmarks for
energy consumption of commercial, transport and domestic sectors will be established by end 2008.
*
The National Energy Database will be enhanced with further disaggregated and refined demand-side date byend 2007.
* A variety of financing mechanisms will be made available by end 2007 to finance energy efficiency improvementprojects in all sectors including collateral substitution to concessionary loans, operated through utilities.Capacity of financial institutions will be developed and assisted to treat energy efficiency improvmentfinancing as a standard item in a portfolio of loans.
*
*
*
State sector agencies identified as major energy consumers will be closely monitored and their energy expenditurewill be separated from recurrent expenditure to assist energy efficiency improvement and cost control. Suchagencies will be mandated to take the lead in procuring energy efficient equipment.
The Energy Efficiency Building Code will be updated and made mandatory to state sector entities by end 2007.Indirect measures through premit issuing agencies will be implemented to encourage the practice of the code byother entities within the same time frame.
Information pertaining to ways and means of energy efficiency improvement will be collected and disseminatedthrough mass media and other suitable channels, facilitating consumers to undertake energy efficiencyimprovment programmes.

National Energy Database and Integrated National Energy Planning
* Ministry of Power and Energy shall immediately establish a national energy palnning team, to address thepolicy issues inter-linkages between sub-sectors, and to investigate important issues such as pricing policyin consultation with public, private and civil society groups.
*
*
*
Sufficient powers required to analyse and make specific recommendations on all aspects or energy sectorperformance, shall be vested with the planning team by 2007. The team will be assisted by the Department ofCensus and Statistics
The planning team shall, by end of 2007 establish improved methodology, if necessary, to develop demandforecasts, simulate development scenarios, intergrate sub-sectoral plans, conduct sensitivity studies, analysepolicy options, and develop forecast energy balances.
The National Energy Database and the analysis on Energy Sector Performance shall be updated and publishedevery year. Summary information of these shall be available on a website, and detailed information will beprovided on request. The first publication shall be for energy data updated until year 2004, to be published byend 2006.
Implementation Responsibility : An integrated national energy plan to cover 25 years into the future shall be prepared bythe National Energy Planning Team of the Ministry of Power and Energy, and published at least once in two years. TheNational Energy Balance and Energy Sector Performance shall by published annually.

Rural Electrification
A special fund will be created for the purpose of funding the Rural Electrification (RE) programmes. All donor funds,government contributions and contributions from the future electricity distribution utilities, (as would be decided by thePUCSL) will be the main sources of funds. The practice hitherto followed in RE Programmes will be closely examined. In thiscontext, the government will study the policies/programs adopted by other developing countries. The government will alsoseriously consider entrusting the management of RE schemes to consumer co-operatives, a policy successfully implementedby some developing countries.
Institutional Responsibility to implement this lies with the Ministry of Power and Energy and the Ministry of Finance,assisted by the PUCSL.
Note : Institutional responsibilities attributed to Energy Conservation Fund will be transferred to the proposed
“Sustainable Energy Authority” when it is established.
